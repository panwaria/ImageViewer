#ImageViewer


A really simple Android application which lets you: 
 - see a collection of photos (pre-bundled with the app)
 - access photos stored in the (pre-installed) Gallery Application
 - set Application Preferences
 - add photograph captions, which can then be locally stored (in Shared Preferences)
