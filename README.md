ImageViewer
===========

A really simple Android application which lets you: 
(1) see a collection of photos (pre-bundled with the app)
(2) access photos stored in the (pre-installed) Gallery Application
(3) set Application Preferences
(4) add photograph captions, which can then be locally stored (in Shared Preferences)
